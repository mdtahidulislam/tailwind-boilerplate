# Tailwind CSS Boilerplate

For tailwind css it needs to install tailwindcss, postcss and autoprefixer. It also requires tailwind.config.js for custom configuration and postcss.config.js.

Finally we need to configure purge settings for building the production code. We also need to remove unused css and keep necessary file.

Unfortunately, all of the above processes have to be done manually. For a developer it is annoying and time killing.

So, use this boilerlate and get fun...

### Start
```sh
clone/download this-repository
open this-directory into VS Code or use any command line tool
npm install
npm run build-css
```

### Configure tailwind
Now configure tailwind.config.js file as you want and build your project.
